## Problem

What are the problems that made us make this application?
 - People wanted to do something without wasting too much time, especially cooking. The problem is that buying ingredients for cooking takes too much time. They have to think about what they need to cook, go to the supermarket, and then spend time walking around to find the ingredients they need.
 - People doesn't know what the name of the food is, the recipe for a food is just from the appearance of the food.

## Solution

**ResepKita** is here to solve this problem. With this application, wanted to cook by themselves. But because of their time-consuming and busy activities, they never started to shop for cooking in the first place. They also have a hard time choosing what to cook. We want to solve this problem by creating an application where we provide recipes and you can automatically buy its ingredients online.
